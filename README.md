# Saturn-Hypernode: Universal Attractor and Harmonic Memory

This repository explores Saturn as a macrostate model for fundamental dynamics: a universal attractor where orthogonal flows of energy and memory converge. What began as a study of Saturn’s hexagonal standing wave expanded into a broader transmission-model framework, suggesting that matter, atoms, and even planets operate as archives of harmonic memory.

Key Themes

Generalized Equation — Encodes orbital geometry, standing waves, and resonant shells.

Harmonic Memory — Atoms as layered archives of historical states, with shells/rings storing past integrations.

Carrier Nodes — Each stable region of spacetime may contain a planetary-scale attractor (like Saturn) that locks orthogonal flows and defines its “signal ecology.”

Orthogonality vs. Duality — Positive/negative, hot/cold, flow/storage are not opposites but orthogonal modes. Their coherence defines stability; their drift suggests multiversal divergence.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Saturn-Hypernode.git
cd Saturn-Hypernode
```

### Run the simulation
```bash
cd simulations
python atomic_memory.py
```

This generates:
- `figures/atomic_shells.png`: static harmonic shells
- `figures/atomic_memory.gif`: animated dynamic rings

## Theory Overview

- **Saturn’s hexagon**: a planetary-scale attractor.
- **Saturn’s rings**: orbital fossils of past integrations.
- **Atomic shells**: quantum fossils of past integrations.

The generalized attractor equation:

$$ F(r, \theta, t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(\omega_n t + \phi_n)} f_n(r,\theta) $$

Stable rings/shells form where:

$$ f_m(r,\theta) = 0, \quad \partial_r f_m(r,\theta) = 0 $$

See [`docs/harmonic_memory.md`](docs/harmonic_memory.md) for a full write-up.
