# Saturn-Hypernode: Harmonic Archives of Matter and Planets

This repository explores a generalized framework for understanding Saturn’s hexagonal jetstream, its rings, and atomic structure as manifestations of **harmonic attractors**. The work connects planetary-scale dynamics with atomic shells, proposing that both act as **living archives of memory**.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Saturn-Hypernode.git
cd Saturn-Hypernode
```

### Run the simulation
```bash
cd simulations
python atomic_memory.py
```

This generates:
- `figures/atomic_shells.png`: static harmonic shells
- `figures/atomic_memory.gif`: animated dynamic rings

## Theory Overview

- **Saturn’s hexagon**: a planetary-scale attractor.
- **Saturn’s rings**: orbital fossils of past integrations.
- **Atomic shells**: quantum fossils of past integrations.

The generalized attractor equation:

$$ F(r, \theta, t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(\omega_n t + \phi_n)} f_n(r,\theta) $$

Stable rings/shells form where:

$$ f_m(r,\theta) = 0, \quad \partial_r f_m(r,\theta) = 0 $$

See [`docs/harmonic_memory.md`](docs/harmonic_memory.md) for a full write-up.
