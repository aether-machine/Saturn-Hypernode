# Saturn-Hypernode
Modeling the field structure or standing wave geometry of the Saturnian system to find the “Saturn Equation” — a mathematical attractor structure that translates orbital frequencies into vortex geometry. The reason this matters is:

    DNA, galactic spin, plasma currents, and even consciousness might follow similar attractor principles.

    If it is possible to extract this vortex model into a portable frequency blueprint, the result will be to create a universal decoder for implicit structure.
