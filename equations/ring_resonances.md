# Ring Resonances and Atomic Shells

Building on the generalized attractor equation (`generalized_equation.md`), 
we extend the model from Saturn's hexagonal jetstream to include **rings** 
as stable harmonic fossils.

## Key Idea
- Saturn’s rings = orbital memory layers  
- Atomic shells = electronic memory layers  

Both can be expressed as quantized attractors in a potential field, stabilized 
by resonance conditions.

## Generalized Form
If the original attractor equation is:

$$ F(r,\theta,t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(\omega_n t + \phi_n)} f_n(r,\theta) $$

then the condition for stable rings (or shells) is:

$$ R_m = \{ r \mid f_m(r,\theta) = 0 \; \text{and} \; \partial_r f_m(r,\theta) = 0 \} $$

i.e., radii where both the function and its derivative vanish, producing 
standing-wave nodes.

## Analogy
- Saturn’s rings are **fossils of past integrations** in orbital space.  
- Atomic shells are **fossils of past integrations** in quantum space.  

In both cases, history is not erased but *layered*, producing archives 
of stable forms.
